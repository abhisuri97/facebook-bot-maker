				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We woke up in Hastings with grey skies as far as the eye could see and so it was rain coats to the ready, shower caps on and wrap the geetar in bin bags time (emergency protocol). It was a fair old slog to rye, our stop for the night. Drenched and ten miles or so in we found a little cafe on wheels called the red pig by the beach and so popped in to warm up and dry off. Upon entering we were greater by a welcoming muso type owner who knew us and our plight through friends and some girls who heard Will&#8217;s radio 6 interview a few weeks earlier. An hour or so later we were well fed, almost dry and even had another £45 for BCUK in our pocket&#8230; that&#8217;s my kind of pit stop and many thanks to you all.</p>
<p>After a long and wet walk into rye we showered and spoke only a little as our jaw bones warmed up. Without sounding too dramatic we eventually &#8216;managed&#8217; to enjoy a night off at The Ship and then The Mermaid, both great watering holes, before much needed sleep.</p>
<p>Refreshed we began the walk to Dymchurch for our show at The Ocean Inn. More rain and a steady hike through Romney Marsh with its scattering of nuclear stoner pikey&#8217;s and derelict carp farms meant for a somewhat surreal hike but at this late stage it&#8217;s going to take more than Kent&#8217;s answer to jeepers creepers to stop these two ramblers cutting through your corn field because you decided to destroy the foot path. Mug.</p>
<p>The Ocean Inn was another hidden gem of the tour. On paper no PA, local pub after a bank holiday weekend and big screen TV&#8217;s sends alarm bells ringing but a great crowd went silent, the TV&#8217;s went off and we played a good ninety minutes of music for a really appreciative audience and raised another £210 for the pot. Great night. Great people.</p>
<p>Apparently our good friends from the incredible Cocos Lovers are meeting us for the walk to Folkestone tomorrow and then gigging with us in the evening and with this brings the sudden realisation that we are almost home. It&#8217;s been over a month now, just me and Will walking this coastline mile after mile, day after day. At times I never thought the end would come (Will&#8217;s puns will do that to the best of them) but if the skies were a little clearer I&#8217;m fairly sure we would be able to look east and see The Lighthouse from here on a good day.</p>
<p>Almost there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hastings has just been granted £11 million of funding to regenerate its seafront and iconic pier which once housed shows for the likes of Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones and upon entering the town from the east and watching a crazed pit bull reduce a child to tears on the beach as it ate chunks of his surf board while it&#8217;s special brew drinking owner threw stones at it&#8230; all I could think was hurry the fuck up.</p>
<p>However as you get beyond the doss houses, half way houses and people living in tents on the beach the old town already shows signs of what&#8217;s to come with its array of independent bars and restaurants dotted in between hardcore penny arcades and stadium sized bingo halls. Amongst these bars we found The Royal Standard, our venue for the nights show and although it was a mix of those listening, those two days into a three day bank holiday bender and a bag thief (who got caught) funds were raised, cd&#8217;s sold and new friends made so all in all another successful night on the long road home.</p>
<p>Just heard tickets for Deal are running low so if you are coming please do buy a ticket as when we are full we are full!</p>
<p>Oh yeah and over £3100.00 now raised. Not too shabby.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a night at the plushest Travelodge I&#8217;d ever seen, we set out for the wonders of Brighton. This was a shortish walk along the coast and was nice and flat- easy. Not. We got caught in a sudden thunderstorm and got completely drenched through to our pants.</p>
<p>On arriving in Brighton our first job was to try and purchase some new stage clobber to try and replace the stuff lost to a Bognor Regis landfill. I found a shirt and Nick purchased a denim number with a picture of a deer on the back. It was clear at this point that he&#8217;d completely lost his mind.</p>
<p>At Brighton&#8217;s show we were delighted to be joined by the brilliant folk singer Beans On Toast, who was also gonna join us on the walk to Lewes. It was great to have someone new to talk to and after an excellent and busy gig and a short bin party we found ourselves doing shots of Sambucca and glasses of rum and ginger at one of Brighton&#8217;s many late boozers. Bedtime was preceded by a surprisingly good burger and Nick spending at least a tenner on hobnobs, sweets and crisps at Londis.</p>
<p>The following morning&#8217;s hangover was a fierce one. The hotel room (which incidentally I realised I&#8217;d stayed in before with Billy Glinn of Cocos Lovers and must be the cheapest/shittest twin room in Brighton) was littered with the remains of Nick&#8217;s 3am snack binge.</p>
<p>We met Mr. Toast at the pier and started on our journey. He picked a good day. Up on the hills between Brighton and Lewes, the sun was warm and the sky blue. The Sussex countryside stretched out around us and other than being briefly followed by the grim reaper (or possibly just a stranger wearing all black) the walk went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>A couple of pints of Harveys later we were at The Lamb, our venue for the evening. Bobby Banjo (who often plays with Beans On Toast) appeared with his girlfriend and despite a somewhat rowdy bank holiday Friday crowd, we all had a laugh and played some tunes.</p>
<p>After the gig we sat in the bar as the crowd slowly drifted out until it was quiet enough for a few more tunes around the bar with Alec the landlord and a couple more pints of Guinness. Marvellous.</p>
<p>When we&#8217;d bid farewell to Beans and crew we made tracks for Eastbourne. This was a gruelling 21 miles in the pouring rain, so it was great to get to a cosy front room for a private house show that evening. A few songs and a few beers later it was time for bed. I fell asleep to the sound of Eastbourne&#8217;s night revellers out in the street. Glad I didn&#8217;t go and have a nightcap at a bar opposite the hotel. Glad I wasn&#8217;t on the receiving end of the drunkern threats being shouted across the street at about 2.30am. Sounded nasty&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the days passed by we found ourselves in the idyllic seaside resort of Portsmouth complete with its eclectic mix of soldiers and students. The evenings entertainment saw us share the stage with various local acts, burlesque dancers and our buddy Tim O T. Tim was great, first time I&#8217;ve had a chance to see him play. The venue, a huge old building with potential looked like it was on its last legs and sadly suffered from Guinness issues. Anyway the show was a stonker so imagine our surprise at hearing the very next day it was closing down. Maybe I meant stinker. Minimal funds raised but in the words of Tescos&#8230;</p>
<p>We cut out losses relatively early in Portsmouth and hit the sack, a boat themed Ibis room you couldn&#8217;t swing a cat in, and looked forward to the anarchy that is Chichester.</p>
<p>The Chichester Inn was a blast, nice venue, good crowd and some familiar face, notable Will&#8217;s old deputy head Gary.</p>
<p>Gary had helped with the booking and put us up in his lovely little caravan by the sea and so after the show we retired there for a few beers. It was all going so well.. Gary even took our clothes with him to wash for us and return the next morning&#8230;</p>
<p>Gary returned the next morning without our clothes (all of them, everything we own) The story went like this. Susan, Gary&#8217;s wife, washes clothes and puts them in a black bag by the front door on bins day. Gary sees bag and runs down the road to throw bag in the bin lorry. Susan says &#8220;where&#8217;s the bin bag of clean clothes?&#8221;. Gary says &#8220;fuck&#8221;. Clothes now in land fill somewhere near Bognor Regis. Goodbye to my favourite denim shirt BUT do not fear hipsters, I founds a new one with some deer on the back.</p>
<p>The next few hours were spent clothes shopping with Susan &amp; Gary in Chichester. Gary was spotted by a mate buying will some cotton pants in M&amp;S. Full story available at remaining live shows.</p>
<p>Alas, these things happen and we are grateful to the both of them for their extensive efforts to rectify the awkward, naked, situation.</p>
<p>Dressed in our new clothes we walked onto to Worthing in fairly miserable conditions arriving at heavy metal venue Bar 42 late afternoon. Tonight however was acoustic night and following a gentle opening set from a passing American singer songwriter who must have been holidaying in Worthing it was business as usual for us ramblers.</p>
<p>Great penny arcades. I won a bumper pack of fake refresher bars.</p>
<p>The end is now near and everyday continues to bring with it another unexpected challenge but from rubbish trucks to burlesque dancers, the show must go on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arriving into Bournmouth we were greeted at the local Premier Inn by the Friday night hen &amp; stag do crowds all glammed up and ready to jäger bomb their way into Monday morning. You could See their lips salivating at the prospect of our miserable smelly bearded acoustic tales of love and hate replacing monthly regular Darren&#8217;s Mobile Disco with his venga bus of classic party hits.</p>
<p>Chaplins is a lovely little venue in Boscombe with a room downstairs which could be used to put on a great show and so we did&#8230; To the best of our ability. The problem was the &#8216;headline&#8217; band didn&#8217;t show meaning the &#8216;promoter&#8217; asked to to play to the above mentioned crowd at midnight instead. Luckily the combination of the venues owner, our utter despair and common sense prevailed and a good room enjoyed our music until near midnight, raised some good funds for BCUK and enjoyed Will spilling a whole pint in (not even over) my guitar.</p>
<p>A few youngsters didn&#8217;t get passed the bouncers so Will played to them outside for a bit as I got food poisoning #3 from a chicken kebab and then it was off to bed before the biggest walk of the tour.</p>
<p>Rising at the crack of dawn the walk through the New Forest to Southampton was quiet frankly boring as shit. That said if the picturesque cliffs of Cornwall had lasted the near thirty miles we would have not got to the gig in time as it took us a whopping 10 hours in total. Will got mugged off for his Ice cream by a donkey and I got pissed off with the amount of dog shit I kept stepping in but otherwise it was just another ramble.</p>
<p>It was also clear skies, blistering sun and the hottest day of the year which I love. Like aids.</p>
<p>Utterly shattered we arrived at The Bent Brief just before kick off and after support from Ieuan Williams and then Rob The Liar it was business as usual. Big thanks to Rob, the place was packed with a great crowd.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now.</p>
<p>No wait.</p>
<p>Mid song a girl walked on stage and began projectile vomiting while Will was playing &#8216;wedding &amp; wars&#8217;. Will decided to use his training from his days as a bingo caller, &#8220;keep calling the numbers if any of the old dears have a heart attack&#8221; and so he did&#8230; With a puddle of sick by his feet.</p>
<p>Thanks Southampton.</p>
<p>Nick</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any self respecting rambler is perpetually excited by a strong 3G signal these days. The prospect of a quick glance through the facebook newsfeed is a brilliant way to break up the monotony of natures beauty. Our room at the Lulworth Cove Inn had neither signal, 3G or wifi. So how one is supposed to enjoy the panoramic views of the stunning Dorset coastline without finding out what someone you met once at a festival had for their tea is beyond me.</p>
<p>The cockerel&#8217;s first call came at 6.30am &#8220;I&#8217;m going to rip it&#8217;s f*cking head off&#8221; Nick mumbled as the proud cock made his jolly morning noises unaware of the hate brewing up in room 12. After a good session the noise finally died down and we started to fall asleep. The clever thing about a cockerel&#8217;s call is he seems to know exactly how long it takes humans to fall asleep, so just as you start to nod off BANG off he goes again. This pattern continued until breakfast time, when we gave in and crawled out of bed.</p>
<p>The walk to Worth Matravers was absolutely stunning. Most of the road ran atop a ridge that offered a 360 degree vista of the surrounding landscape, with the ocean on one side and Dorset disappearing off on the other. This walk also involved walking terrifyingly close to the Lulworth military firing range, so for a large part of the day the sound of artillery fire echoed across the hills besides us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to play at The Square &#038; Compass for a while as it is regularly listed as one of the country&#8217;s best pubs. After arriving Nick and I ate a pasty and drank a Guinness while sitting out in the beer garden staring out at the beautiful sea views.</p>
<p>Shortly before the show my parents arrived unannounced, with my father sporting a tour t-shirt. He looked insane as he had it on over the top of his collared shirt and underneath a suite jacket. It was really nice to see them though, especially as we&#8217;ve spoken before about going The Square &#038; Compass. Even though my dad looked like he hadn&#8217;t dressed himself. On a side note, this prompted the second awkward performance of monkey on a rock. Anyone who knows the lyrics will know why.</p>
<p>This was possibly my favourite gig so far. The room was small but packed and the audience were quiet and attentive and seemed to really enjoy our sets. It was great to see some people from previous gigs making it over to see the show. Kev the manager kept our glasses full for the whole evening and we shared a whiskey after closing time before retiring to our room above the pub.</p>
<p>3G was none existent at the Square &#038; Compass, i&#8217;m beginning to realise at my favourite places it usually is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Dorchester&#8217;s bin party and bin party after parties parts 1 &amp; 2 we leapt out of bed and headed south for Weymouth. The reason we leapt was that it was only a 9 mile canter and we thought if we were quick enough we could complete it before the hangover kicked in. Great thinking but no such luck and by mid afternoon we found ourselves growing increasingly irritated by the ongoing procession of mobility scooters which hog Weymouth promenade as you arrive. I&#8217;m not sure if simply being a fatty makes you eligible for a mobility scooter but we take our hat off to Weymouth&#8217;s resident mobility scooter sales rep regardless for having the initiative to push those things in the endless greasy spoons which surround the penny arcades.</p>
<p>Side note on the gulls. They were relatively well behaved which I think supports my earlier theory on the vermin when you look at Weymouth in general (gulls I mean). That said after a few beers and feeling brave Will cornered and tried to intimidate one down a back street but it just stood there and laughed at him, although no counter attack.</p>
<p>Anyone that knows Will and I will know that we are feared as two of the south coats penny arcades biggest hustlers and Weymouth got turned over good and proper. And so after grabbing a bite to eat and with pockets full of sweets, cuddly toys and water pistols we retired to the hotel room with the coastal path trek to Lulworth Cove the next day in mind.</p>
<p>(The hotel was haunted and so I wrote songs about ghosts. They won&#8217;t be getting played though as they make me sound like a pussy.)</p>
<p>The coastal walk to Lulworth Cove was in my opinion the most sunning yet. Although Cornwall and Devon&#8217;s coastlines may be more vast, sheer and wild the area around Durdle Door with its colour and softer seas create my favourite picture of the English coastline. This combined with twenty degrees of blue skies made a difficult walk generally enjoyable and some six hours later we sat at the Lulworth Cove Inn now over half way through the walk feeling somewhat content.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the gigs start again and we are building toward the largest walk of the tour through the New Forest to Southampton but before that we have one of our most anticipated shows at The Square &amp; Compass. I just noticed Jason Isbell is playing there the night after us which I would have loved to have seen. Still, for now we will have to make do with dinner and drinks beneath a full moon over Lulworth Cove.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leaving Lucy at the Hotel in Bridport was hard for lots of reasons. The hardest of which was knowing that her journey home was a few hours long, while mine consisted of a solid two weeks of walking.</p>
<p>Most of the route I&#8217;d worked out to Dorchester followed a roman road that ran just north of the modern A road. I hadn&#8217;t realised quite how harsh the uphills were going to be though, and there was no way the map could&#8217;ve warned me about the hail storm we got caught in an hour or so into the walk. For the most part the road was very direct (as you&#8217;d expect from a roman road) and we arrived into sunny Dorchester at about 5pm.</p>
<p>After checking into our accommodation, and wolfing down a couple of pizzas and a a bottle of wine at the local Prezzo we ventured to the gig venue, Tom Browns Pub.</p>
<p>On paper this gig should&#8217;ve been a terrible night. Monday in a small town at a local pub. Wrong. It was rammed. The band who&#8217;d organised it &#8220;The Small Society&#8221; did a brilliant set and are well worth checking out. Thanks in part to the generosity of thd landlady we managed to smash our charity record by a country mile, raising about £250 for BCUK, while at the same time having one of the best evenings of the tour.</p>
<p>We were amazed/delighted to see a return customer at this gig too. A chap called Jim who&#8217;d come to our Exeter gig happened to be in town and made the effort to come and see us for a second time.</p>
<p>After the show Jim, Nick and I purchased a 4 pint takeaway of Guiness from the pub which they dispensed to us in an old milk bottle. We stumbled outside and congregated around a bin up the road, hence inventing the humble &#8216;bin party&#8217; which will no doubt shape the future of late night drinking over the next few weeks/years. There&#8217;s nothing like supping Guinness from a milk jug while the overpowering smell of rotten vegetables wafts gently passed. </p>
<p>After the bin party I have to admit things get a little bit hazy, though I do recollect going into somebodies flat at one point and watching them perform an utterly flawless version of Bohemian Rhapsody on a classical guitar. It was a great night.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re roughly half way through our journey now and it&#8217;s amazing how those first few days feel like a lifetime ago. Back on the road in a a few hours, it feels hot today. Apparently there&#8217;s a heatwave coming&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought a night off would mean waking up refreshed and full of energy. Not at all. I could&#8217;ve done with another forty hours sleep. We got out of the Hostel for about 9.30ish and thanks to studying the map in the curry house the night before we knew the route to Bridport was a killer. There was some excitement in the fact that we would cross the border into Dorset, the third county of our adventure.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few hours we managed to experience the full range of bad walking conditions. Horrendous coastal hills, busy roads, rain &#038; a distinct lack of decent pubs. The route we&#8217;d chosen took us over the cliffs and then in land behind Lyme Regis, before the final stretch to Bridport. As we approached the town the contour lines on my OS map seemed to show an almighty hill which for a while I thought might be a misprint. Eventually it appeared before us, stretching up towards the clouds. The path that lead up the hill was sign posted as &#8220;Hell Lane&#8221; and as we made our way up we came to understand where it got it&#8217;s name. Hell Lane was more of a river than a lane, and one has to walk upstream for most of the way up the hill, ankle deep in running water. At the top of the hill the path starts to cut into the ground, until at the top you are walking through a gorge fifteen feet high on either side. At the very top it was amazing. Real Jurassic Park vibes. Old graffiti plastered the sides of the gorge on either side, etched into the rock, and in a natural alcove someone had placed a Virgin Mary figurine and some small bundles of dried flowers to make a small shrine. I spent a few minutes reading the graffiti. On one bit someone had scratched the words &#8216;turn back now&#8217; deep into the rock. Later that night I was told this was geographically one of the highest points of the south coast. I&#8217;ll finish this post with some photos of Hell Lane to give you an idea.</p>
<p>We descended from Hell Lane into Bridport and got to The Ropemakers, our venue for the evening. After a couple of pints and an appearance from a large percentage of the Marks family we played our sets. Nick was great, and it was nice to meet his family for the first time considering I&#8217;ve known him for a decade. Once again we managed to raise a huge amount for the charity pot (£140). The guys who promoted the show were great people and are running a festival called Outcider which I&#8217;m playing in the summer. Check it out. About half way through my set I looked up and saw Lucy. At first I thought I was hallucinating but then realised she had come to surprise me. Baring in mind she has one day off a week and the round trip is a seven hour drive, this was a ridiculously good effort. It was wonderful to spend the rest of the night with her, we drank wine for a bit and for a few hours a tiny slice of reality had been restored. I realised how much I miss sitting at home in Canterbury watching Lucy watch &#8216;Don&#8217;t Tell The Bride&#8217; while I look for cheap hotel rooms on the south coast. Ah those were good times. Here&#8217;s those photos of Hell Lane. Amazing place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember it well, I was very young and all these grow-ups were staring, clapping and cheering while over enthusiastically saying&#8221;walk to mummy Nicholas&#8230; Good boy&#8221;. In my head I was weary. Although the idea of being able to walk to the biscuit tin meant more biscuits it also meant no one would ever fetch me those biscuits again.</p>
<p>After another coastal hike into Sidmouth we were welcomed by Ian &amp; Alison at The Radway Inn. They took over the venue not too long ago and are doing a great job of pushing the wonderful local music scene (which peaks with the annual Sidmouth Folk Festival) through out the year.</p>
<p>The Radway was a good mix of locals and muso&#8217;s and we smashed the £100 mark for donations once again which sends us in the direction of 2k which is unbelievable and so a huge thank you to all in attendance who put their hands in their pockets.</p>
<p>Sidmouth is a nice, friendly little coastal town and I had been in search of one for a few days as I think I have a theory for the behaviour of the resident seagulls in English Coastal towns. It goes &#8211; The bigger bastards the locals the less aggressive the seagulls&#8230; And one in Sidmouth the size of a dog chased Will on foot as he scoffed his bag of chips&#8230; When will that boy learn!</p>
<p>The guinness flowed into the night and before we knew it Alison was waking us up and feeding us as Ian handed us walking sticks for the hike to beer. &#8216;Walking sticks?!&#8217;, we thought &#8216;we are practically expert ramblers don&#8217;t you know?&#8217;. Ian was right though, the coastal walk to Beer was the most challenging route to date and combined with gale force winds and torrential rain we stumbled into town just before dark for our night off and after a curry and a few glasses of wine we retired to the YHA for some much needed rest.</p>
<p>Before I sign off I just want to say a special thanks to the group of families with kids called Tarquin, Elderberry &amp; Bishop-Kingsley who decided to meet outside our room at 6am the next morning and discuss the perils of non organic bog roll and why Tarquin simply can&#8217;t eat red meat &#8211; I hope you had a wonderful holiday.</p>
<p>Bridport next.</p>
